# Categorical data sets and visulization for interpretation-
## categorical datasets are the defined sets of objects that are grouped together under defined labels. The labels can either be male/female, yes/no, passed/failed etc. These datasets are devoid of numeric values for calculations or we cannot perform any calculation on these datasets.
## WHY DO WE NEED CATEGORICAL DATASETS:-
### To rule out relationship between two datasets, proportion between different groups and also to know about differences obtained before and after treatment. 

# based on the questions needed to answer we have different types of statistical tools
